# AR_DRAW
The AR Finger Draw App is an interactive computer vision project that allows users to draw on virtual canvas using only their hand gestures and webcam. This project leverages OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking, enabling seamless and intuitive air drawing experience without physical tools like mouse or touchscreen.
